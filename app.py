with Parkinson's disease. Activities such as walking, swimming, cycling, or yoga can help improve mobility, 
flexibility, and balance. Exercise has been shown to alleviate symptoms, enhance motor function, and contribute to 
overall well-being. Additionally, it may help in reducing the risk of falls and improving cardiovascular health. <br></p>

<p style='font-size: 19px; text-align:justify'><span style='background-color: #3b5aa3; padding: 5px; border-radius: 50px;'>Medication Adherence:</span> Adhering to the prescribed medication regimen is crucial for managing Parkinson's disease. 
Patients should ensure they take their medications at the right time and in the correct dosage as prescribed by their 
healthcare provider. Consistent adherence can help in controlling symptoms, maintaining stability, and mitigating 
fluctuations in motor function associated with the condition. <br></p>

<p style='font-size: 19px; text-align:justify'><span style='background-color: #3b5aa3; padding: 5px; border-radius: 50px;'>Nutritional Support:</span> A balanced and nutritious diet plays a vital role in supporting overall health for individuals 
with Parkinson's disease. Consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats 
can aid in managing symptoms and promoting well-being. Additionally, ensuring adequate hydration and moderating 
intake of certain substances, such as caffeine and alcohol, can help minimize potential adverse effects on symptoms. <br></p>

<p style='font-size: 19px; text-align:justify'><span style='background-color: #3b5aa3; padding: 5px; border-radius: 50px;'>Mind-Body Therapies:</span> Incorporating mind-body therapies such as meditation, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques can

            Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement control, resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Common symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. While its precise cause remains elusive, both genetic predisposition and environmental factors are implicated. Diagnosis relies on medical history, neurological examination, and imaging tests. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms and may involve medication, physical therapy, and deep brain stimulation. While incurable, management strategies can significantly enhance quality of life. Ongoing research endeavors seek to unravel novel therapies and elucidate the disease's underlying mechanisms.

        ‚≠ï In May 2022, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022‚Äì2031. The action plan will address the challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders such as PD that exist worldwide and ensure a comprehensive, coordinated response across sectors. This includes raising policy prioritization and strengthening governance, providing effective, timely and responsive diagnosis, treatment and care, implementing strategies for promotion and prevention, fostering research and innovation and strengthening information systems.

    <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
       ‚≠ï A WHO technical brief entitled Parkinson disease: a public health approach is available for policy-makers, health programme managers and planners, healthcare providers, researchers, people with PD, carers and other stakeholders. It outlines the important action areas for intervention in PD including global health policies focused on prevention and risk reduction, education and awareness and access to treatment and care at various levels of the health system. WHO‚Äôs iSupport, a knowledge and skills training programme for carers of people living with dementia is available as an online course and a hardcopy manual. iSupport Lite includes easy-to-read posters and a brief video that can act as a quick reference or a refresher, reinforcing previously acquired caregiving skills and knowledge.

        ("What is Parkinson‚Äôs?", "There are over 50 different symptoms that people with Parkinson‚Äôs can experience, though each person has a different combination of some but not all of them. The nature and severity of symptoms can vary considerably from one individual to another as well as from day to day. In the early stages of the condition, symptoms can be vague and non-specific such as constipation, loss of smell, fatigue, sleep disturbances, unexplained depression, anxiety or muscle pain. The four key motor symptoms are tremor (shaking), muscle rigidity (stiffness), bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and postural instability (balance issues and falls). Generally, you must have at bradykinesia plus another for a diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs to be considered. It is worth noting that in 30% of cases a resting tremor will not be present. A good place to start building your understanding is by reading some of our resources and information sheets."),
        ("What causes Parkinson‚Äôs?", "Just like someone with diabetes cannot produce their own insulin, someone with Parkinson‚Äôs cannot produce enough dopamine. The cells in a particular part of the brain die off, causing a reduction in the level of this neurotransmitter brain messenger chemical). Dopamine helps with mood and movement, so these areas are particularly affected. There are several theories on what causes Parkinson‚Äôs; however, currently we do not have a clear picture of what triggers this dying off process and why some people are affected, and others are not. Best knowledge to date says it is a combination of head trauma, family history, pharmaceutical and/or environmental toxins like pesticides that trigger onset of parkinsonian symptoms. Being male and of older age also are risk factors. What we do know is that every person with Parkinson‚Äôs experiences a loss of dopamine in the brain, along with which combination of symptoms and their progression that is unique to them."),
        ("What will my doctor do if Parkinson‚Äôs is suspected?", "There is currently no test or biomarker that can definitively diagnose Parkinson‚Äôs. Everyone‚Äôs combinations of Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms are different making it tricky to diagnose. A GP or neurologists often looks at a clinical history plus motor symptoms, like the stereotypical slow and stiff movements and shaking."),
        ("Is there a cure for Parkinson‚Äôs?", "Not yet. Parkinson‚Äôs usually has a slow progression but is currently incurable. However, there are a variety of medications and treatments that can help control or reduce the symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs. Many people with Parkinson‚Äôs live full and productive lives for decades."),
        ("What can I do to manage my Parkinson‚Äôs?", "Being proactive about your Parkinson‚Äôs will also help you manage any fear or anxiety you may be experiencing due to the diagnosis. It is very important to gain an understanding of which of your symptoms are caused by Parkinson‚Äôs. The good news is that there are a wide range of early intervention strategies you can employ to continue to live well with Parkinson‚Äôs for a long time. Assemble a care team that will help you plan your wellness journey."),
        ("Is Parkinson‚Äôs hereditary?", "Parkinson‚Äôs can run in families because of faulty genes, but this is very rare (about 10-15% of cases). Most people with Parkinson‚Äôs have idiopathic Parkinson‚Äôs, where the cause is unknown. A person‚Äôs risk of developing Parkinson‚Äôs may also be influenced through their genes, although exactly how these make some people get Parkinson‚Äôs is unclear. Research into Parkinson‚Äôs has made remarkable progress. There is very real hope that the causes, whether genetic or environmental, will be identified and the precise effects of these will be understood in the near future."),
        ("Where can I find help?", "National advocacy Parkinson‚Äôs Australia develops position statements and policies on matters of national significance. Our policies aim to ensure that Australia provides an environment for the Parkinson‚Äôs community to promote the best possible quality of life for people with Parkinson‚Äôs. We also work with Parliamentary Friendship Groups ‚Äì non-partisan forums for Federal Members to meet and interact with community causes."),
        ("How can I help someone who has Parkinson‚Äôs?", "Learning about the condition and what symptoms your person living with Parkinson‚Äôs may experience can be a big support. There needs to be an understanding that Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms fluctuate and may cause variability from day to day or even hour to hour and can affect your plans. However, maintaining a social life is very important to the wellbeing of both the person with Parkinson‚Äôs and their families. Being flexible and having patience are key to accommodating people living with Parkinson‚Äôs. If you are living with or caring for someone with Parkinson‚Äôs, you should also consider your own personal needs and look after yourself‚Ä¶ seek counselling if necessary. Register yourself and any young carers on the Carers Gateway and see Carers Australia for more information. Just as there are many support groups for people with Parkinson‚Äôs, there are also support groups for carers and young carers.")
